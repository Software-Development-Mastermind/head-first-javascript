This repository is a publicly maintained set of notes for the Head First Javascript book. Please feel free to add notes as you see fit!

The style of note-taking that you will see is called "markdown". It's essentially a special syntax for creating HTML-like styling without all the templating code. To learn more about markdown click here: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
